- it seems that Orgad Shaneh likes the name ntfsfixboot, which may
  indeed be somewhat more fitting than ntfsreloc; the program
  should thus probably be renamed to this name, too

- when running on disk files (for example QEMU raw files), you can
  (supposedly) use "fdisk -l $file" to get the geometry data; example:

  $ fdisk -l /dev/mapper/plain-windows2000

  Disk /dev/mapper/plain-windows2000: 4294 MB, 4294967296 bytes
  128 heads, 63 sectors/track, 1040 cylinders
  Units = cylinders of 8064 * 512 = 4128768 bytes
  Disk identifier: 0x7c4aab41

			   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
  /dev/mapper/plain-windows2000p1   *           1        1040     4193248+   7  HPFS/NTFS

  (The device /dev/mapper/plain-windows2000p1 should be the same as
  /dev/loop0p1; the latter resulted from losetup -f
  /dev/mapper/plain-windows2000, with automatic partition table
  recognition enabled in the kernel (modprobe loop max_part=100, put
  'loop max_part=100' into /etc/modules to enable this automatically
  on reboot).)

  $ ntfsreloc -b -h 128 -t 63 -s 1 -w /dev/loop0p1

- it didn't actually solve the problem with windows in QEMU hanging
  after writing the "Booting from Hard Disk.." message, after increasing
  the size of the disk and using gparted to increase the size of the
  partition p1. (Neither did the recovery process from the w2k
  installation disk help.)
